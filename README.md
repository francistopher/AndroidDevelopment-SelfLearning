# Save The Cat! Color Matching - Android

A repository of the source code of my first [Android](https://www.android.com/) App posted on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) written in vanila [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which I had to teach myself and learn from scratch.

## Prologue

After I dropped out of CS, I stayed with my parents for the rest of the year. I was thinking about teaching myself mobile development during that time. I wanted to go to UF but I had too many credits to be considered a 1st year student. I had to get an A.A. degree first, I applied to community college to increase my chances to get into UF. But I missed the deadline to enroll for the Spring 2020 semester at PBSC, either by accident or by purpose, lol.

I previously made a similar game without the cats and the hairballs using [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)). I remebered tasting a genetic test tasting strip when I took AP Biology with Neuberg. I was [choking like a cat who had a hairball lodged in its throat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wWlMNBrvY) after I tasted the strip.
