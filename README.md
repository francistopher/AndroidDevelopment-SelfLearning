# Android App Development & Kotlin - Self Learned

Self learned Android App Development and Kotlin by making an Android App. From project creation to app submission, a month, check the commits. I knew Java, made it easier to learn Kotlin. Haven't touched Android Development in a while so of course I don't remember everything.

## Prologue

After I dropped out of CS, I stayed with my parents for the rest of the year. I was thinking about teaching myself mobile development during that time. I wanted to go to UF but I had too many credits to be considered a 1st year student. I had to get an A.A. degree first, I applied to community college to increase my chances to get into UF. But I missed the deadline to enroll for the Spring 2020 semester at PBSC, either by accident or by purpose, lol.

Multiplayer never worked since the beginning, I made an SSL Certificate Creation mishap and couldn't figure out how to solve it.
